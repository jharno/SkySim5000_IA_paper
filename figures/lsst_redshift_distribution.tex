\caption{Redshift distributions in our simulations, either taken from the Year-1 specifications for LSST (solid) or from a matched selection applied to an HOD galaxy catalogue (dashed, see Sec. \ref{subsec:HOD}).
{\color{orange}Niko: we need to label the $y$ axis. Also i would reword this to say "Tomographic bins" instead of the redshift distributions?}}
