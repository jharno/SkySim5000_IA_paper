\caption{\textit{Tomographic bins used in this work.} 
We show the redshift distribution of source galaxies, binned into five equipopulated tomographic bins in our simulations.
Bins from LSST Year-1 are given in solid lines while our matched selection applied to an HOD galaxy catalogue are given in circles ( see Sec. \ref{subsec:HOD}).}
