\caption{Ratio between the shear correlation functions with and without IA in tomographic bin combination 2-5.
The brown and green symbols show measurements from simulations constructed with $b_{\rm TA}$ = 0.0 and 2.0 respectively,  the black solid and dotted lines shown their predictions, while the blue symbols are obtained by rescaling $b_{\rm TA}$ = 1.0 simulations using Eq. \ref{eq:bta_rescale}.  }
